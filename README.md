# üéÆ Editing a Game with GitHub Desktop

This guide will show you how to edit a game using GitHub Desktop, a graphical user interface for Git. By creating a branch and making changes in the branch, you can modify the game without affecting the main codebase. Once you're done making changes, you can merge the branch with the main codebase to incorporate your changes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) on your computer.
2. Clone the repository containing the game you want to edit by clicking the "Clone or download" button on the repository page and selecting "Open in Desktop".
3. Open GitHub Desktop and select the repository from the list of repositories.
4. Click the "Current branch" dropdown and select "New branch".
5. Enter a name for the new branch and click "Create branch".
6. Make changes to the game by editing the code files in the repository.
7. Once you're done making changes, commit the changes by clicking the "Commit to <branch>" button in GitHub Desktop and entering a commit message.
8. Push the changes to the branch by clicking the "Push origin" button in GitHub Desktop.
9. Open a pull request by clicking the "Create pull request" button in GitHub Desktop and following the prompts.
10. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed and approved by the repository owner.
11. Once the pull request is approved, merge the branch with the main codebase by clicking the "Merge pull request" button in GitHub Desktop.

## üìù Notes

- Be sure to test your changes thoroughly before submitting a pull request.
- Follow the coding conventions and style guidelines used in the original codebase.
- Be respectful of the original author and other contributors when making changes.
- If you're unsure about how to make a change, ask for help in the repository's issue tracker or discussion forum.
